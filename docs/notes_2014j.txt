SN2014J is heavily reddened. There is significant uncertainty on theR_v and hence, the shape of the bolometric light curve will also change with the assumption on R_V

Churazov et al. 2015 report a Mej of 1.38 based on gamma-ray observations.

Srivastav et al. 2016 report an Mej by fitting the bolometric light curve of 14J with a simple model from Vinko et al. 2004. They find Mej ~ 1.3 M_sun


We use the late phase bolometric light curve along with the reddening parameters from Amanullah et al. 2014 (which agree well with the parameters from the polarimetry presented in Patat et al. 2015)

R_v = 1.4; A_v = 1.88

Resulting ejecta mass is 1.56
