A few notes on the CSP M_ej-M_ni distribution

1. The CSP bolometric light curves were calculated using stephane's code. Ejecta masses calculated with the exact same assumptions as Stritzinger et al. 2006

aims:
	a. what is the slope of the M_ej - MNi relation
	b. what is the fraction of SNe with M_ej < 1.4 M_sun (conditional, of course, on the assumptions of q, k_gamma, v_e)?


Note 1: the calculated M_ej from Richard's code for the CSP sample has a similar fraction of M_ch explosions to what I calculated with the more simple S06 approach.
( ~ 45% of all SNe have sub-Mch ejecta masses, although richard's sample doesn't have 91bg-likes, 2 of which are in the complete CSP sample I was looking into)

Note 2: Max said the Boaz Katz gets t0 about a week later than his. Adding (very, very crudely), 7 days to the t0 value of S06 shows that ~ half the objects are M_ch ejecta masses

Note 3: Comparing the M_ej - M_Ni distribution to what Mike (Childress) gets for his objects in the 56Ni nebular line paper, there seems to be a clear split in the relation with half the objects clumping near the Mch border.
The ejecta masses are calculated here using the relation between stretch and M-ej found for SNfactory sample in Scalzo et al. 2014a

Using only the t0 values for the Scalzo et al. 2014a sample and converting to ejecta masses using the assumptions in stritzinger et al. 2006, the fraction of super-Mc is as high as for the CSP sample.


Maximum value of M_ej as calculated by me: 1.89 M_sun

As calculated using the t_0 values from Richard's fits:
