Notes on the ejecta mass calculations for the fast decliners paper

--> Including the NIR (JH) contribution for the bolometric light curve there are only three SNe that have enough late time information to calculate the ejecta mass
(SN2005ke, SN2006mr, SN2007on)

--> Without the NIR, there are two more, namely SN2007ax, SN2009F.

** All have ejecta masses significantly below 1 m_sun.
(without the NIR, the total calculated ejecta mass is slightly lower than with the JH).

--> A_v doesn't affect the final ejecta mass estimate (!).
