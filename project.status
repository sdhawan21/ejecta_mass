Ejecta mass calculations using Jeffrey 1999 were interesting. however, W. hillebrandt and M.Kromer have suggestions for how to modify the formula using numerical techniques to calculate the integral for q-factor

bruno's views: Let it be till we chat with M. Kromer (bruno's in Stockholm, and will also be at EWASS). 


Markus says that there isnt much to change in the formula that Richard and Max have used. However, the difference in the method can be a good cross check for the absolute scale (N(M_ej > 1.4) )

Anything > 1.4 M_sun would be interesting
