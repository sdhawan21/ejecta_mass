calculate ejecta masses for SN Ia

1. Fit an energy deposition function to the late time bolometric light curve
2. using the fiducial (transparency) time and physical estimates of other parameters in eqn 4 of Stritzinger et al. 2006, (or Scalzo et al. 2014) derive M_ej from t_0

Aim: To have a framework for measuring the diffusion timescales of SNIa from their bolometric behaviour (fit a cobalt energy deposition)

Now, a comparison between the t1 from photometry and from nebular spectra can tell us about ejecta stratification

02-12:
	Create an Mni-Mej plot from the CSP data. Compare to models. 	
18-12:
	Inference (if Bruno is convinced that this indeed a correct calculation of the M_ej and t_0)

	--> There appear to be two clusters in the data, one with sub-Mch masses and another clumped near the Chandrasekhar mass, hinting towards possibly different explosion models explaining the Mch and sub-Mch scenarios
	** Similar to whats seen in Scalzo et al. 2014
