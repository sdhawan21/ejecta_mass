calculate ejecta masses for SN Ia

1. Fit an energy deposition function to the late time bolometric light curve
2. using the fiducial (transparency) time and physical estimates of other parameters in eqn 4 of Stritzinger et al. 2006, (or Scalzo et al. 2014) derive M_ej from t_0

Aim: To have a framework for measuring the diffusion timescales of SNIa from their bolometric behaviour (fit a cobalt energy deposition)

Now, a comparison between the t1 from photometry and from nebular spectra can tell us about ejecta stratification
