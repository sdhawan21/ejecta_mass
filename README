Stuff for Kevin,

For  Nickel mass of 0.51, and risetime of 19 days I get to=64.289702.

However, I notice that the energy deposition function in that fit (plot1X.eps)
does not cross through the peak luminosity, which, I think it should. 

So then if I change the rise time to 15 days, I get to = 59.202709.


so now I re-calculated the ni mass based on a risetime of 18 days, this gives 
Nimass = 0.56  L = 2.1 10^43

then in the fit I set riset = 18, and get the plot, it's reasonable, and t0 value 
is to =       58.487185


Figure XXX. The best fit radio-active deacy energy deposition function 
(middle solid line) to the UVOIR 
light curve (blue squares) of SN~2001ay. The top solid lines correspond to the case
of complete trapping of $\gamma$ rays and positron (i.e. $\tau >> 1$), 
while the bottom solid line is the case of complete $\gamma$ ray escape (i.e. $\tau << 1$). 
The vertical dotted line indicates the epoch at which the fit begins.  
The best fit to the UVOIR light curve suggests the eject became optically thin 
59.2$\pm$2.5 days past maximum. 



Note that the second point past the vertical line was 
extrapolated from a linear bestfit to the preceeding week of photometry.
