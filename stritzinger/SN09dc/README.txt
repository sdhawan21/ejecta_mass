stefan finds two Ni masses for 2009dc depending on the adopted rise time:

 With logL(tmax) = 43.47±0.11 [erg s−1]
and tmax = 22d, a 56Ni mass of M0	= 1.78±0.58 M⊙ is Ni
derived. For tmax = 28 d, a 56Ni mass of M0	= 2.21 ± 0.75 Ni
M⊙ would be required to power the light curve

and an ejecta mass of  ∼2.8 M⊙
