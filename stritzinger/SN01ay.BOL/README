There are too many points from too many telescopes taken within the same
48 hour period throughout the whole campaign. Looking at the figure of the
light curves it looks to me that the blue points have the best temporal 
coverage. And some additional nights to extend the 
time coverage:

BVRI all blue circles. These are KAIT data.
     all yellow up triangles. These are CTIO 0.9-m
     
also looks like one very late point at +114 from Nickel in BVRI, will use it

for u band, all four epochs from 3 setups.
