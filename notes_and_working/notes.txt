Radioactive energy deposition governs the light curve through 2 main process,1. 'gamma rays emitted in the decay
2. energy transfer to fast electrons in the ejecta through compton scattering

--> timescales for the transfer are much smaller than the dynamical or decay time scales of the SN (at photospheric phases), which makes the steady-state assumptuion extremely plausible.
