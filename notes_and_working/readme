This directory contains all the notes and workings through papers on ejecta mass calculations for SNIa

Jeffrey '99 does a fantastic, detailed analytic calculation of the late-time light curves of supernovae and their exponential/quasi-exponential behaviour.

Although most notes are made on paper, a short assimilation is also present here.
